login and registration pages is doen , now which page to complete
Answer
Now that you have completed the login and registration pages, you can move on to creating the other pages for your Smart Home Energy Management System (SHEMS) project. Here are the pages you should work on next:

Dashboard or Home Page: After a user logs in, they should be directed to a dashboard or home page. 
This page can display a welcome message, a summary of the user's energy consumption, and links to other pages,
 such as service locations, devices, and energy consumption views.

Service Locations Page: Create a page where users can view, add, and remove their service locations. 
This page should display a list of the user's service locations (retrieved from the ServiceLocation table),
 and it should include a form where users can enter the details of a new service location to add to the ServiceLocation table.

Devices Page: Create a page where users can view, add, and remove their devices.
 This page should display a list of the user's devices (retrieved from the Device table),
 and it should include a form where users can select a device type and model (from the DeviceModel table)
 and a service location (from the ServiceLocation table) to add a new device to the Device table.

Energy Consumption Views: Create several pages (or perhaps sections of a single page) that display 
different views of the user's energy consumption. These views could be implemented as charts or tables,
 and the data for these views should be retrieved from the Event and EnergyPrice tables. 
You might want to use a charting library like Chart.js or D3.js to create these views.

Remember to create routes in your app.js file for each of these pages and connect them to your PostgreSQL database to retrieve, display, and update data as necessary.
