# Smart Device Management and Energy Consumption Analysis System

## Project Overview
This web-based application provides an interface for managing smart devices and analyzing energy consumption. It allows users to register, login, list, add, and remove service locations and smart devices. Users can select device types and models from a pre-stored list and access various views to understand their energy consumption patterns.

### Key Features:
- **User Registration and Authentication:** Secure login and user account management.
- **Device Management:** Add, list, and remove smart devices like refrigerators, ACs, dryers, etc.
- **Model Selection:** Choose from pre-stored models like Bosch 800 refrigerator, IKEA smart light bulb, GE 4500 Air Conditioner, etc.
- **Energy Consumption Analysis:** View and analyze energy usage with 4-5 different graphical representations.
- **Concurrent Access Management:** Ensures smooth operation in a multi-user environment.
- **Security:** Protection against SQL injection and XSS attacks.
